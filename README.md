# Temporum: The Melclex Incident.
This was created as a project for school. It was build for arcade 2.5, and as such doesn not support the new tiled system. The code should work perfectly fine in 2.5. A link to a video showcasing the program can be seen here: https://youtu.be/we82_W4nbjY

# Note:
Temporum is no longer in development. That finished in november of 2021. No changes, bug fixes, or improvments will be made to this repository.
