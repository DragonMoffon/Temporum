A node stores what the\n\"initiate\" says, and what the \"response\" says.\nIt also stores the joints that connect to and \ncome from the node.\n\nThe initiate is the person who started the \nconversation, In this case it's you.

However most \nof the limitations come from parts of the\nsystem that haven't been implemented yet.\n\nYou can only have three joints come from a\nnode, you can't put images into the node, \nand there are no numbers in the system.",

Firstly the \ntext, and ui is not finished it uses placeholder\nsprites. \n\nThere are no pages, these pages will split the\ninitiate and responses text into chunks that\nwill show one after the other. Currently it \njust spills over. There are also no text effects\nlike shaking which will come later.\nThere are also no characters in the box to the\nside of the ui which will show who is talking.\nFinally the largest issue still to be fixed are \nthe missing conditionals and action API.",

They also have an \n\"expression\" which is simply what the joint\nshows. When talking each button you see\nis a joint and the text is the joint \"expression\"",
